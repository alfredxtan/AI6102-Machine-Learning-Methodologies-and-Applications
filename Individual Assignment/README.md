This folder contains the codes and workings to the assignment. The questions are roughly:

1. Derive the learning procedure of reguarlized logistic regression for multi-class classification problems.
2. Perform 3-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter $C$ tuning for linear SVM, and hyperparater $C$ and $\gamma$ tuning for non-linear SVM, using RBF kernel (requires running of script)
3. Show that the linear soft-margin SVMs is equivalent to an instance of empirical structural risk minimization.
4. Derive a closed-form solution, using the kernel trick, to extend a regularized linear regression model to solve nonlinear regression problems.
