# AI6102-Machine-Learning-Methodologies-and-Applications

This repository contains source codes and final report for one individual assignment and one group project in AI6102.

The individual assignment consists of four questions, one of which requires writing a Python script. The group project is open-topic, and our group chose to work on a previous [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions/overview).
